# Principal-Components
I have used iteration method to find eigen values and corresponding eigen vectors. I made the code generic so that a little changes will be required for the new data.
For using a new variance-covariance matrix, just update the matrix sigma and in the last portion in the while loop just use iic < n ; n is the no of variales + 1.
